# Plan for KSS-012: Show Images from Server

## 1. Backend (Conceptual):
*   Define API endpoint (e.g., `/api/images`) to serve image URLs.
*   Implement logic to fetch image URLs from a database.
*   Ensure proper authentication/authorization for image access.

## 2. Frontend (kss-slideshow):
*   **Data Structure:** Update `kss-slideshow/types/Slide.ts` to include an optional `imageUrl` property for slides.
*   **API Integration:** Create a utility function to fetch image URLs from the backend API.
*   **Component Enhancement:**
    *   Modify `kss-slideshow/src/components/slides/FullBleedImageSlide.tsx` or create a new slide type.
    *   Implement logic to display images using the fetched `imageUrl`.
    *   Handle loading states and error scenarios gracefully.
*   **Data Population:** Update `kss-slideshow/src/data/kssSlides.ts` to include slides with `imageUrl` from the conceptual API.
*   **Styling:** Ensure images are responsive and styled correctly using TailwindCSS.

## 3. Testing:
*   Unit tests for API utility.
*   Integration tests for slide component rendering with images.

## 4. Deployment:
*   Update CI/CD pipeline to include any new backend services if applicable.
*   Ensure frontend can consume images securely.
